<h2>Why <i>https://mail2.its.ac.id/</i> and <i>https://webmail.its.ac.id/src/login.php?bag=lupa</i>?</h2>
<p>Okay, i will analyze a website for login or something about email its like forget password feature and don't know email & password feature</p>

<p>First, from that picture, we can know that the login feature is doesn't have a forget password, we know that forget password is very important because if we forget the password, we can reset and make a new password. But from that picture, we can know that the forget password or something like that is can be reach from an website in point 2</p>

<p>Now, this is the website that we click from point 2 in first image. From that picture, is it good because there is a forget password feature, but the feature is little useless because if you haven't made a few questions for this feature, you can't reset your password</p>

<p>Now, lets to next feature that can help us to recover the email & password its. From that picture, we can know that we can recover the email and password using nrp and password integra. But the nrp form is using old format that just 10 digit, and the new format is need 14 digit, from this, the feature is a little useless because we don't know how to convert from new format to old format, if we know, there is no guarantee our data will exist</p>
